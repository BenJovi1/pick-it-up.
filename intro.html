<h2> Types of guitars</h2>
    <p>There are many different types of guitars, but the most common are acoustic, electric, and classical.<br> Each type has its own unique sound and feel.</p>
    <h3>Acoustic guitars</h3>
    <p>Acoustic guitars are the most common type of guitar. They are typically made of wood and have a hollow<br> body that amplifies the sound. They are great for beginners because they are easy to play and don't<br> require any additional equipment.</p>
    <h3>Electric guitars</h3>
    <p>Electric guitars are typically made of solid wood and require an amplifier to produce very much sound.<br> They have a thinner neck and lighter strings, making them easier to play for some people. They are <br> great for playing rock, metal, and other genres that require a louder sound.</p>
    <h3>Classical guitars</h3>
    <p>Classical guitars are similar to acoustic guitars but have a wider neck and nylon strings. They are<br> typically used for playing classical music and fingerstyle techniques. They have a softer, mellower <br> sound compared to acoustic and electric guitars.</p>
